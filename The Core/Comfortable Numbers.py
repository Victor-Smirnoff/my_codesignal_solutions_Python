# Comfortable Numbers
# Let's say that number a feels comfortable with number b if a â‰  b and b lies in the segment [a - s(a), a + s(a)], where s(x) is the sum of x's digits.
# How many pairs (a, b) are there, such that a < b, both a and b lie on the segment [l, r], 
# and each number feels comfortable with the other (so a feels comfortable with b and b feels comfortable with a)?
# Example
# For l = 10 and r = 12, the output should be solution(l, r) = 2.
# Here are all values of s(x) to consider:
# s(10) = 1, so 10 is comfortable with 9 and 11;
# s(11) = 2, so 11 is comfortable with 9, 10, 12 and 13;
# s(12) = 3, so 12 is comfortable with 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.
# Thus, there are 2 pairs of numbers comfortable with each other within the segment [10; 12]: (10, 11) and (11, 12).
